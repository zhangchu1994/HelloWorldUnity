There are 2 important steps on setting up the COOP Action Game Kit.
1. First extract the contents of "/Assets/COOP Action Game Kit/ProjectSettings.zip" to the root
of your Project, replacing the original Project Settings you had in your project. That’s important so the kit can receive the input and layers correctly.

2. Include the Scenes that are inside “Assets/COOP Action Game Kit/_Scenes” in your Build
settings, otherwise the game will be unable to load the scenes and menu.
