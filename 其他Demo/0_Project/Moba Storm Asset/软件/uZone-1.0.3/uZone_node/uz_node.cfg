%% Set the hostname or IP-address of the uZone master to connect to under 'host'.
%% Under 'port', set the portnumber the master is listening to for incoming connections. 
%% This should correspond to the port set in the master's cfg-file.

%% This is where you register all the games that are to be available on the node.
%% Each game will be asssociated in uZone by the identifier under which its path and flags are defined.
%% The first letter in the identifier needs to be lowercase to be properly recognised by uZone.
%% Each game needs a path to where its executable can be find, while extra flags are optional.
%% Flags should be defined inside double quotation marks as can be seen below.

%% Note: Unity-specific flags containing one or more extra parameters need to have the flag and each
%% parameter put in separate elements in the list, or Unity will fail to recognise this command.

{games, [ 
			{gameExample, 
					[ 
						{path, "C:/exampleserver.exe"}
					]},
			{gameWithFlags, 
					[ 
						{path, "C:/exampleserver.exe"}, 
						{flags, ["-logFile", "exampleserver_Data/logs/log.log", "ExampleParameter"]}
					]}

%% This flag sets whether to let uZone assign each instance with a port number from the range given in port_range.
%% This port is unique for each instance on this node, and uZone will refrain from creating new instances on this node
%% if all the ports within the range has already been assigned. If this is set to false, all instances will have their port
%% property set to 0 and there will be no limit on the number of concurrent instances.
		
{port_allocation, false}.
		
%% Use these fields to set the port range that the uZone-node will use to allocate ports from.
%% With 'port_allocation' set to true, uZone will only start an instance on a node as long as 
%% at least one port in this range is available.

					{min, 7000},
					{max, 7010}

%% This field sets the IP or hostname that each instance running on this node will be associated with.
%% This is not used internally by uZone, but is simply associated with the node and its instances in uZone.
%% Most common use-case is to set this to the IP used by the instances to listen for incoming clients.
